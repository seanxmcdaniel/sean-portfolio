  ## Project Description
  
My portfolio was created using 'create-react-app'. It includes some of the projects I have developed and collaborated on, as well as a resume section where you can download my resume, a contact section, and an 'about me' section.

  ## Usage
  
  Each of the photos of my projects will take you to the respective deployed application. You can also view each project's repository by clicking 'GitHub Repository' on the overlay of any of the project images. 
  
  To download my resume, navigate to the 'Resume' section and click the 'Download My Resume' button.
